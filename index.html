        <p>From Dragon Ball to Naruto and One Piece, anime's shonen series  tend to be some of the most popular in the medium. But which are the best of them all?</p>

        <p>Even though shonen can be derided for its formulaic nature, it still remains one of the most popular anime genres. That’s largely due to the fact that most series know what they’re best at and stick to it — impressive fight scenes, strong and often likable character archetypes, and powerful stories surrounding themes of friendship, family, and being an all-around decent person.</p>

                    <p>Hiro Mashima’s story of a guild of magic users who for some reason like to punch, kick, and slice things more than actually casting spells has enjoyed a great deal of popularity over the last decade. <em><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/fairy-tail/">Fairy Tail</a></em> has come back not once but twice — with the recent version winding down the original manga’s storyline.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail</em> is best known for its likable cast and absurd scenarios. While some argue &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that it's a rip-off of its contemporaries such as One Piece, there's no denying that it's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;still a great anime worth watching.</p>

                    <p>Welcome to the adventures of Class 1-A, full of the Best Boys and Best Girls that anime has to offer. The lead Best Boy is Izuku Midoriya, a young teenager who starts out without superpowers in a world where almost everyone has a Quirk. When Midoriya meets his idol and biggest superhero of them all, All Might, he winds up pulled into an adventure that will lead to him becoming the greatest hero ever.</p>
                    <p><em><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/my-hero-academia/">My Hero Academia</a></em> might not be doing anything wholly new, but author Kohei Horikoshi is taking the tropes of the genre and executing them better than anyone else in the game right now. The only thing holding the series back is it's simply too new, with the franchise only starting in 2016.</p>

                    <p>Masashi Kishimoto’s story of a young ninja rejected by his city and working to one day become the leader of his village captured the imagination of every kid and teenager who grew up in the 2000s. Alongside <em>Bleach</em> and <em>One Piece</em>, <em>Naruto</em> would become part of <em>Shonen Jump’s</em> "big three." While <em>Bleach</em> lost quite a bit of its luster by the end, <em><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/naruto/">Naruto</a></em> was just as strong as ever when it finished.</p>
                    <p><em>Naruto</em> was so popular it even wound up inspiring <em><a href="https://www.cbr.com/anime-like-boruto-needing-legacy-series/">a legacy manga series</a></em> based on Naruto’s son, Boruto, adding a generational aspect to the series. The only thing holding this series back from even greater heights is the absurd amount of filler.</p>

                    <p>Even though <em><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/dragon-ball-z/">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> isn’t the first shonen anime ever, it’s definitely the most influential. In one way or another, almost every other hit shonen series has taken inspiration from <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>. After all, a shonen series is nothing without transformations and training sequences. Even time skips were popularized with this series.</p>
                    <p><em>Dragon Ball Z’s</em> lack of character development and generally simplistic plots can leave something to be desired even amongst shonen fans, but one must pay homage to the genre’s origins and acknowledge <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> as one of the most popular series of all time.</p>

                    <p>There are some pretty strong arguments for Eiichiro Oda’s saga of Monkey D. Luffy and his gang of pirates in search of ultimate treasure being the best shonen series of them all. It stands as the most popular of <em><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/shonen-jump/">Shonen Jump’s</a></em> "big three" over twenty years after it began, and Oda just keeps surprising people with new reveals and callbacks to plotlines from years prior.</p>
                    <p>Supposedly, Oda is almost done with the storyline now. However, if there’s one flaw to <em>One Piece</em>, it has to be the pacing. Twenty years of storytelling means the anime has to use quite a few tricks to slow things down and not outpace the manga.</p>

Its manga was published in <em>Weekly Shonen Sunday</em>, making it a definite shonen title. <em>Komi Can't Communicate</em> follows Komi Shoko, a high schooler with severe social anxiety that makes it extremely difficult for her to talk to other people. However, she has a goal of making 100 friends by the end of her high school career.</p>
                    <p>Enter Tadano, Komi's first friend who found that communicating through written notes is an effective way of talking. From there, Komi's life turns upside down as she befriends the entire school and experiences all kinds of wacky things along the way. <em>Komi Can't Communicate</em> has a lovable ensemble cast with all kinds of personalities, from the emo otaku, Nakanaka to the chaotic nonbinary spitfire, Najimi.</p>

                    <p>Admittedly, <em><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood/">Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood’s</a></em> early parts aren’t quite as strong as the original series as it moves too fast.

It's been going on since the late '80s, and Hirohiko Araki is showing no signs of slowing down. Anybody who calls themselves a fan of shonen needs to watch this anime.</p>
                    <p><em>JoJo's</em>  is a generational storyline that constantly reinvents itself. It's a true ground-breaker for the genre, and with every new part, its campiness and absurdity only increase. <em>JoJo's</em> has become such a cultural phenomenon that other anime series blatantly reference it. Most notably, other series have incorporated the "menacing" onomatopoeia, and some characters have done <em>JoJo's</em> poses or mimicked the Joestars' battle cries.</p>
